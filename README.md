   I worked on this project as a part of CSCI 5020G Collaborative Design & Research course while pursuing my MSc. in Computer Science from Ontario Tech University. The objective was to work on a problem faced by Indigenous people of Canada. So my focus was to work on mental wellbeing in the Indeginous community. I have read several articles and papers where different facts came up such as
    <ol>
      <li>A study conducted at 1988 in US show men are more likely to be diagnosed with mental disorders than women (46% vs. 18.4%)</li>
      <li>Most fully employed people had no diagnosis of mental disorders.</li>
      <li>The value of myth and story telling in physiological process.</li>
      <li>Positive correlation between depression & anxiety with issues of individual identity.</li>
      <li>Traditional physical activities like hunting and spiritual ceremonies like smudging.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

   I proposed some features for the website based on the issues mentioned above.
    <ol>
      <li>A platform for Indigenous people to post videos on their cultural struggles, how they have overcome them, stories passed through    generations and success stories</li>      
      <li>Setting up a help line formed by dedicated trained volunteers.</li>      
      <li>Chatbot trained on cultural terms and successful identification of different groups.</li>      
      <li>A custom search engine for fetching info on cultural training and spiritual ceremonies near a person.</li>      
      <li>A sign-up system to build a database and remind people of programs.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
  The website reflects on these proposed features. I have mainly built the front-end of the website. I have hosted the website on 000webhost. This website can be accessed from https://mental-wellbeing.000webhostapp.com/
